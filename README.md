The way our group has been running the app is by cloning the repository, opening the project folder in Android Studio, and then running the application on either an emulator or a Nexus 5X in the case of the one person.

Accessing all features of the app requires a firebase database and the app be allowed to access photos on the Android phone.

ParkHere is a sharing economy app, similar to Uber and AirBnb in that it allows ordinary people like you and me to rent out parking spaces in front of their homes to drivers looking for a place to park their cars at large and busy events. Users are required to provided their names, email, picture of id, and phone number. Users belong to one or both of these groups: Owners, or people renting out their parking spaces to others, must provide an address, and Seekers, those who seek parking spaces. Users may be both and Owner and a Seeker at the same time.

Owners may post their parking spaces, provided that they include an address, description, pricing, availability by hour, and choose one of three default cancellation policies.

Seekers searching get all spaces within 3 miles of their search spot and may filter by several characteristics, such as truck, handicapped, and compact. Seekers then choose from the available hours of the space to book, and the payment goes to ParkHere. Once the booking is completed and the allotted time for the booking is up, the payment is released to the owner.

NOTE: Our server project (server-side) is entirely based on Firebase. Screenshot in the zip file
